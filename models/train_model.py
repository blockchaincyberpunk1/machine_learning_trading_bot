Explanation:

Import necessary libraries: Import the required libraries, including pandas, numpy, train_test_split from Scikit-Learn for data splitting, RandomForestClassifier from Scikit-Learn for a Random Forest model, and accuracy_score from Scikit-Learn for model evaluation.

Load historical data: Load historical data from a CSV file located at "../data/historical_data.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame called data. This assumes that your data file is in the specified location.

Data preparation: This is a placeholder comment where you would typically include data preprocessing and feature engineering code. In this section, you would clean, transform, and engineer features in your dataset to prepare it for training.

Split data into training and testing sets: Use the train_test_split function to split your data into training (X_train and y_train) and testing (X_test and y_test) sets. This is crucial for evaluating your model's performance.

Train a machine learning model: Create a Random Forest Classifier model with 100 trees and train it using the training data (X_train and y_train).

Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data (X_test) and store the predicted values in y_pred.

Evaluate model accuracy: Calculate the accuracy of the model's predictions by comparing them to the actual target values (y_test). The accuracy_score function computes the accuracy, which represents the fraction of correctly classified instances.

Print model accuracy: Finally, print the accuracy of the trained model on the test set to assess its performance.
